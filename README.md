# Fual_detection_and_prediction_of_water_pump
In a particular area there is a small team that takes care of the water pump of a small area far from the big town, there were 7 system failures last year. Those failures cause huge problems to many people and also lead to some serious living problems for some families. The team can't see any pattern in the data when the system goes down, so they are not sure where to put more attention. So the data is collected from sensors. All the collected data are raw. There are 52 sensors in total. Sensors collect data every minute. This dataset contains 3 main group of data,

Time stamp data.
Sensor data (52 series).
Machine status: This is the target label that has to be predicted when the failure will happen.

Sensor data of 5 months from April to August is provided. Each row contains sensor readings for a minute. Dataset contains a total 220320 data points.
